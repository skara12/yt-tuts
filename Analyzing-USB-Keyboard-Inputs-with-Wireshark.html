<p>Wireshark is a Packet Capture Tool and if USBPCap is installed it is also useful to capture Data on the USB Port.
 After starting Wireshark we can choose USPCap2 to see the Data on all USB Ports. In this Tutorial we are intrested in the Keyboard 
 Input Data. So we can use the Filter with the right host Adress and type usb.src == "Host_Adress" in the Filter Field.</p>

 <p>Now only Datastream from the Keyboard as Host to the Pc as Destination will be captured. When analysing the Packets in the Leftover 
 Capture Data we can see the keycodes when a key is pressed. Pressing "a" results in 04, "b" in 05 etc.</p>
